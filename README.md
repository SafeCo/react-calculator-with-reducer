## What I've learnt
This project allowed me to gain further familarity with React.

In this particular project I placed an emphasis to get better acquainted with reducer, as I continued I also included context API in order to pass props to child components without having to pass it as props to each child component on every level.

I understand given the complexity of the project Context Api wasn't really necessary however it provided good practice.
